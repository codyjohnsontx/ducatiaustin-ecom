# Ducati Austin E-Commerce Site

This repository hosts the Ducati Austin e-commerce site, built using React and Vite for an optimized and efficient development experience.

## Project Overview

This setup provides a minimal configuration to get a React application up and running with Vite. It includes Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for a smooth development workflow and ESLint rules for code quality.

## To-Do List

- [ ] Set up user authentication (e.g., OAuth, JWT)
- [ ] Implement product catalog with search and filter functionality
- [ ] Build out shopping cart and checkout flow
- [ ] Integrate payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)
- [ ] Add responsive design for mobile and tablet devices
- [ ] Create an admin dashboard for inventory management
- [ ] Implement review and rating system for products
- [ ] Optimize performance and perform SEO enhancements
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for key features

## Plugins

Vite supports two official plugins for integrating React:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Utilizes [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh, enabling instant updates during development.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) as an alternative to Babel for even faster development cycles.
